This is a set of problems from Boot.dev about Python, I made this because I wanted to learn the lessons without paying the subscription needed for the built-in IDE

# Why don't I pay for the built-in IDE?

Because simply put I'm unemployed and don't have the money for things, leeching off parent's money

# How often will this repo get updated?

As long as I have the drive to keep working on the problem sets and get better at coding

## File names

This repo will follow the curriculumn of the boot.dev lessions, so it would make sense for make to give them file names that are accurate to what chapter they answers, along with the number of the lesson
something like:

> chapter-num_lesson-num_lesson-name.py

## UPDATE

I got the membership.........so I'll stop doing this
I was getting kind of annoying and slow for me to keep doing this, the ordering of the files and whatnot, it doesn't help much when it comes to learning

## ANOTHER UPDATE

I realize that I'm addicted to protecting my spree, and I want to make sure I finish this without losing my streak, so I'll use scummy tactics instead >:)
Can't lose shields on hard questions if you don't test in the site itself :)
can't believe i'm tryharding a coding course
