This is a set of problems from Boot.dev about Python, I made this because I wanted to learn the lessons without paying the subscription needed for the built-in IDE

# Why don't I pay for the built-in IDE?

Because simply put I'm unemployed and don't have the money for things, leeching off parent's money

# How often will this repo get updated?

As long as I have the drive to keep working on the problem sets and get better at coding
