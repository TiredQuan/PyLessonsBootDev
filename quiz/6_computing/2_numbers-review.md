# Numbers Review

### Integers

In Python, numbers without a decimal part are called Integers.

Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, 3 and -3 are both examples of integers.

### Floats

A float is, as you may have guessed, the number type that allows for decimal values.
`my_int = 5
my_float = 5.5`

\_**\_ and \_\_** are numerical types in Python.
